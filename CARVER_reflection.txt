Angela's Reflection

Prompt: Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with
publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducible research affects
computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study?

Currently, I have an organized file system for managing documents for graduate school. This is partially due to
my advisor's request. He specified that I don't use spaces in my document name so that he can use the command line
to open those documents. Additionally, he asked that I didn't say "final" on the end of my drafts of documents
but rather just number drafts sequentially. I have come to agree that this is a better method so that I avoid file
names like "Carver_proposal_FINALFINALREALLYFINAL.docx." 

I don't yet have a lot of code, so I haven't had to try too hard to keep tabs on my versions of code. However, 
I see how GitHub will become extremely useful to me for future work. This is especially true if I need to 
make code presentable for publishing rather than just for me.

Non-reproducible research is a detriment to computational biology and bioinformatics as well as any specific 
subfield of biology, including my field of quantitative genetics. Because of this, version control becomes
important. That way, you can keep track of changes you have made to your code and go back to various versions as
needed for explanation of how you arrived at your final product. This can help others reproduce your 
experiment.

Additionally, github becomes important for sharing code with others. If they have access to your exact code,
they can set up and run the same experiment. If it yields similar results, this would support your 
conclusions in your work; it's good for you personally and for science as a whole.
