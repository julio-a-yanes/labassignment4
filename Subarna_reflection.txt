Right now, I do not need to use any kinds of code for my work. As a 
result, I have little/no experience on this version of coding and 
document management. However, I have plan to use this technique in my 
future work. 

Reproducibility is an important parameter in computational 
biology and bioinformatics. Retraction of publications in this sector 
is happening a lot more than usual. In my field (Microbiology), 
reproducibility crisis also happens. As a result, researcher cannot 
recreate their work or arrive the same conclusions makes it difficult 
to validate the original work.
