I manage my documents and code using a structure file storage system in 
dropbox. Although I take care to label files using informative names, 
organize files in a way that makes sense, and create copies of 
experimental code versions to avoid overwriting originals, I have had 
situations where code has gone missing, where files were saved/stored 
incorrectly, and where I've had to search for previous versions of 
files/directories on the dropbox website. Importantly, I do not think 
these systems are robust and reproducbible.

I believe that non-reproducible practices hinder computational biology 
and bioinformatics. Specifically, such practices make it difficult to 
evaluate the merit of new work presented. Moreover, not having access 
to data and code makes replication impossible, which should be at the 
core of the scientific process. This is also true in cognitive 
neuroscience, my chosen field of study. Having completed this 
assignment, I am enthusasitc about incorporating these tools into my 
science.
